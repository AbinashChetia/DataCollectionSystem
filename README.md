# Data Collection System
This is a Java application that can collect data w.r.t. three different sample templates (Census, Salary, Employment) and export the data as a CSV file. It can also import CSV data, provided the data is in one of the three supported templates.

The executible JAR file is located in the ```store``` folder.
